//OKAY here the for rach and the for of loop of aaray does the samw work UKKK//!!!
//let's try and revise the for off loop in js.

let A =[10,20,30,40,50];
for(let n of A){
    //console.log(A);  // it will print the entire array here 
    //console.log(n);  // and this will print the elements in array not entire array same as forEach() method   
    //now lets perform some operation with the values
    console.log(n+10);
