let Arr1 = new Array(); //this is one type of creating an array 
let arr1 = [];         // and this is another type of creating an arrays in js

//so here we will fo with 1st method

Arr1.push(1);
Arr1.push(1);
Arr1.push(2);
Arr1.push(4);
console.log(Arr1);

arr1 = ['Narayana','Nitin','Pooja', 'Aarti', 'Chota Chiikuu'];
console.log(arr1);
//also we will check the length of an  both arrays
console.log(arr1.length);
